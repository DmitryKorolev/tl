# Design backlog

Open design questions for `tl` — decisions not yet made, or made but not yet
pinned in an ADR. Each item leaves the backlog by landing in an ADR (new or
amended) or by graduating into an implementation task when its stage starts.
Decisions already made are recorded in their ADRs (and git history); this lists
only what is still open.

Status: Stages 0 and 1 are built (the verified kernel and the MVP work
loop). Stages 2–3 are **partly built**: the agent surface (skill, `help --json`,
discovery pointer), the free verbs (`reopen`/`stats`/`log`), rich human output,
`list` open-by-default + tree-by-default (`--flat` for rows), labels
(`label add/remove/list`,
`list --label`), the **full `refs/tl/log` sync transport**
(local leg, read-time refresh, remote fetch/union/push, and the HLC skew window
— proved convergence-safe), and **auto-sync** (ADR-0021: the best-effort
post-write local publish, plus the symmetric pre-transact absorb that refreshes
a write's view before its guards — ADR-0016 write-path freshness), the Stage-2
ergonomics verbs (`defer`/`undefer`, `dep path`/`dep critical` — the
dependency trees render on `why`/`unblocks`, not a separate `dep tree` verb),
and bulk `import` (Stage 3) have landed. Still open: `edit`.
Everything below remains stage-gated (decide when building that surface) or a
forever-contract surface that freezes on first implementation.

## Sync, discovery & local concurrency

- Discovery: bare repos, `.git`-file worktrees, `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` [low]
  — discovery for bare repos, `.git`-file worktrees, and
  `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` is undefined; delegate to `git rev-parse
  --show-toplevel`/`--git-dir` and state the bare-repo policy. (ADR-0012 handles
  linked worktrees/submodules — each its own boundary.)
- Network-FS behavior is undecided [low] — a `.tl/` on NFS/SMB is
  "documented-unsupported" (convergence holds via the nonce; ownership + HLC
  monotonicity do not), but no doc decides detect-and-warn vs silent-proceed.
  Decide; if detect, give `doctor` (and optionally `init`) a best-effort FS-type
  probe that *warns* (not a hard error, since convergence is unaffected) —
  ADR-0015 + ADR-0011/doctor.

## Build & proof infra

- Compiled-kernel-vs-spec property cross-check [low] — the mechanism now
  exists (`Tests/CrossTests.lean`: fixed-seed random op multisets; fold
  order/dup-insensitivity, join laws, ready soundness+sortedness,
  unblocks = ready-diff, rollup totality, all against the compiled
  functions); the residual is recording that shape — corpus, seeds, sampled
  theorems — in an ADR so the gate is contractual rather than incidental
  (ADR-0004 / a test ADR).
- "No task-ID leakage" lint pattern/scope [low] — pin the regex and excluded
  paths (`docs/`, `Tests/.../fixtures/`, the importer's `ext:*` source refs) — AGENTS.md /
  a lint spec.

## Distribution (before release)

- Native-Windows gating test pass [low] — the gating test pass for native
  Windows is open, spec'd only if it is promoted from Tier-2 (WSL is the Supported
  Windows path). The Win32 FS/git-shell-out *design* is in ADR-0015 §7 / ADR-0006.
- Signed-release verification is under-specified [med] — ADR-0006 says
  `curl|sh`/brew "verify and fail closed" via keyless Sigstore/cosign, but never
  pins the expected `--certificate-identity` + `--certificate-oidc-issuer` the
  verifier checks against — without which a fail-closed verifier accepts *any* valid
  Sigstore cert, hollowing out T3. Secondary (weaker): no Rekor/transparency-log
  disposition, offline-verification stance, or key/identity rotation/revocation
  path. Pin the expected identity/issuer and a rotation procedure (ADR-0006,
  cross-ref ADR-0014 T3).
